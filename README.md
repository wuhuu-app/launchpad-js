# ðŸ›« Launchpad

> **Current status:** Work in progress.

Launchpad is a JavaScript library for managing API session hooks. Launchpad helps you quickly and painlessly integrate the front-end user interface with API calls (or mock calls) as easy as calling a hook after proper setup. So, you can maintain both of them with extra ease.

The coolest thing is that UI developer can call API by simply calling the hook function, with loading state built-in and their favorite objects as parameters. Everything will be exactly following your configuration.
